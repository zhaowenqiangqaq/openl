On the host side, `print()` is implemented directly by the host-side C library, and this produces different results on Linux and Windows. Windows terminates lines with CR+LF characters (seen as an extra `^M` in some text editors); in contrast, Linux terminates lines with only the LF character, so the tests need to account for these differences. The tests handle this by keeping separate expected test result files (a.k.a. oracle files) for Windows and Linux.

On the enclave side, `print()` redirects to syscall API in the enclave runtime to call an API on the host side. On Windows, the syscall layer redirects to the Win32 `WriteFile()` API, and on Linux, it redirects to the POSIX `fwrite()` API. In either case, the enclave `print()` implementation controls the line termination rather than the host OS, so `print()` produces the same behavior in both cases.
