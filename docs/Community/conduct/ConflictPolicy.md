Conflict Resolution
===================

We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often
yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage
in behavior that violates the project's [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address
the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and
easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If
you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is
threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment
where participants feel welcome and safe.

Reports can be made to any member of the [Community Governance Committee](
../governance/README.md). It is the duty of the committee members to receive
and address reports while maintaining the confidentiality of the reporter.

We will investigate every incident, but you may not receive a direct response. We
will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported
incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the
project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and
provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity
of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused.
In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyoneâ€™s
safety, we may take action without notice.
