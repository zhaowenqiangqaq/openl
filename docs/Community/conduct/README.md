Community Conduct
=================

The Open Enclave SDK Project Community strives to be an inclusive, welcoming,
and friendly place for all contributors.

All community members agree to abide by the
[Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and we look to the community leaders to
uphold the [Project's Core Values](../Governance.md#Core-Principles).

We acknowledge that sometimes minor disagreements may occur, and have written
down our general views on how conflict between community members
[should be handled](ConflictPolicy.md).

Incidents should be reported to the
[Community Governance Committee](../governance/README.md), and will be handled
in accordance with our
[Incident Response Guidelines](IncidentResponseGuidelines.md).
