# Growth Plan

## Introduction

The Open Enclave SDK is an
[Incubation stage](https://github.com/confidential-computing/governance/blob/master/project-progression-policy.md#incubation-stage)
project of the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC), with an approved
[Technical Charter](/TECHNICAL_CHARTER.md).

One requirement for Incubation stage projects is to develop, in
conjunction with the mentor assigned by the CCC Technical Advisory
Council, a growth plan for reaching the
[Graduation stage](https://github.com/confidential-computing/governance/blob/master/project-progression-policy.md#graduation-stage)
over time.

## Graduation Stage Acceptance Criteria

This section tracks the progress towards the Acceptance Criteria for the
Graduation Stage, as defined by the CCC:

- [ ] Have a defined [governing body](README.md) of at least 5 or more members
(owners and core maintainers, or similar technical role), of which no
more than 1/3 is affiliated with the same employer. In the case there
are 5 governing members, 2 may be from the same employer.

- [ ] Have a healthy number of [committers](../Committers.md#list-of-committers) from at least two organizations.
A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who
can accept contributions to some or all of the project.

- [X] Adopt a [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- [X] Explicitly define a project [governance and committer process](../Governance.md). This
is preferably laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references a
CONTRIBUTING.md and OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus
committers.

- [ ] Have a public list of project adopters or users for at least the
primary repo (e.g., ADOPTERS.md or logos on the project website).

- [ ] Other metrics as defined by the applying Project during the application
process in cooperation with the TAC.

- [ ] Receive a supermajority vote from the TAC to move to Graduation stage.

## Plan

1. Invite contributors from other organizations to become maintainers as
   they demonstrate good contributions via PRs and/or Issues filed and/or
   code/design review feedback.

2. Expand to other TEEs and other OS's by inviting contributions
