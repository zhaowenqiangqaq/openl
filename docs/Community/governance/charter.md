Governance Committee Charter
============================

This document defines the charter of the Open Enclave Community Governance Committee.

----

When making decisions, the Community Governance Committee uses a "consensus
seeking" process. This means that most decisions should be reached by consensus,
but when that fails, the Committee calls for a vote where the super majority
(two-thirds) wins. This is to prevent obstructionism by removing the possibility
of a one person veto.

Quorum for Community Governance Committee meetings requires at least two-thirds
all members of the Community Governance Committee to be present. The
Community Governance Committee may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will
be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

All decisions by vote, whether during a meeting or otherwise, require a super majority
vote of all members of the Community Governance Committee.

The running minutes for the Community Governance Community meetings are located
at [aka.ms/openenclave/cgc](https://aka.ms/openenclave/cgc).

Committee Responsibilities
--------------------------

The primary responsibilities of this Committee are:

- to establish and ensure the health of SIGs and WGs in support of the overall project health
- to maintain membership of the Committee itself, adding or removing as defined in this charter
- to define the governance structures of the Open Enclave SDK project as a whole
- to assist in the resolution of disagreements between community organizations when necessary
- to support the community through handling any code of conduct incidents and reports
- to work with the mentor assigned by the Confidential Computing Consortium
(CCC) in tracking a [growth plan](growth-plan.md)
- to take the Linux Foundation course [Inclusive Open Source Community Orientation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-open-source-community-orientation-lfc102/) and help the community follow its principles

This Committee is not intended to make technical decisions, as those should
generally be made by agreement among contributors PRs are reviewed and merged,
and within the respective SIG and WG organizational structures.

Where disagreements take place and need further resolution, those can be brought
up with the Committee as part of its responsibility to maintain the project's
community health.

Regarding Codes of Conduct
--------------------------

In addition to granting rights, the Committee must also remove committer rights
and membership from those found to be violating the project's Code of Conduct or
otherwise negatively affecting the project's community health. It is duty of
each committee member to receive and address reported violations of the Code of
Conduct while maintaining the confidentiality of the reporter.

Meetings and Committee Obligations
----------------------------------

The Community Governance Committee should meet regularly, for example, once a
month. This meeting is a private meeting among just the Committee members to nominate
new committers and Committee members. Priority consideration should be given to
those actively contributing to the project. The Committee uses the consensus
seeking process outlined above when making decisions, including adding or
removing any members. The Committee should also discuss the community's health
and work to resolve any negative issues.

In order to maintain a healthy developer community, it is recommended that the
Committee also host a regular public community meeting. This meeting should be
open all members of the community, and start with an open forum to hear
questions or concerns from the community. Any remaining time in the meeting
should be used to discuss and review open pull requests or issues (especially
including design documents).
