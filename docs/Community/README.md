# Open Enclave Community

Welcome to the Open Enclave Community! We're excited that you're here.

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the community.

We are a friendly and inclusive bunch, and strive to live up to the project's [core principles](Governance.md#Core-Principles). All members of the community should follow the [code of conduct](conduct/README.md).

## Communication Systems

The [communication](Communication.md) page has more details. Bear with us - we're
still assembling the comm-systems!

## Community Structure

The Open Enclave project is supported by the following types of groups:

* **Committees** represent components of the community governance itself, which
  generally do not own a code deliverable, but are responsible for aspects of
  community structure and health. See the [full governance doc](Governance.md)
  for more details about how these groups are organized.
* **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** are persistent open groups that focus on
  one area of the project. SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings
  (meetings, minutes, chat rooms). Anyone in the community is welcome to
  participate in a SIG
* **Working Groups** are temporary groups formed to address issues, often
  crossing SIG boundaries. A Working Group doesn't own code or other long-term
  artifacts, though it may engage with one or more SIGs and support the creation
  of various artifacts. A Working Group can report back and act through SIGs.


Each Committee, SIG, and WG may have its own meetings and comm channels,
generally described in a README within a directory dedicated to that group.
We're still bootstrapping this part of the organization, so we'll update this
document with more details soon.
