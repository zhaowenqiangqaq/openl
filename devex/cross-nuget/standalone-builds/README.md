# Standalone Builds

These standalone scripts allow the bits from each OS, and distribution to be built separately. Once all the required bits have been built, please refer to the [packaging step in cross-platform documentation](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/tree/master/devex/cross-nuget#packaging).
