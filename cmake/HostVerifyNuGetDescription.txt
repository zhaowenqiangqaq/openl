Open Enclave Host-Side Verification Library is an SDK for building applications
in order to perform host-side enclave verification in C and C++.

Host-side enclave verification means that a non-enclave application is trying to
authenticate an enclave's hardware and software settings so that the application
can determine whether or not to trust the enclave.
